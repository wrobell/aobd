Python library for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle ports.

The code is fork of

- https://github.com/brendan-w/python-OBD
- https://github.com/peterh/pyobd
- https://github.com/Pbartek/pyobd-pi

The goals

- use bytes only for command handling
- asyncio based API
- speed up serial port communication by getting all data at once instead of
  single byte reads
- multi-command communication
- improved error handling

Required Python 3.5 or later and pySerial (https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)
library.

Quick install (library has no release yet)::

    $ git clone https://github.com/wrobell/aobd.git
    $ cd aobd

Example of reading vehicle RPM::

    import asyncio
    import aobd

    async def reader(dev):
        await dev.connect()
        response = await dev.query(aobd.commands.RPM)

        print(response.value)
        print(response.unit)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    dev = aobd.OBD('/dev/PORT')
    loop.run_until_complete(reader(dev))

Command-line tools allow to list available commands and read data::

    $ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/aobd-list /dev/PORT
