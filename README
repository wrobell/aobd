Python library for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle ports.

The code is fork of

- https://github.com/brendan-w/python-OBD
- https://github.com/peterh/pyobd
- https://github.com/Pbartek/pyobd-pi

The goals

- use bytes only for command handling
- asyncio based API
- speed up serial port communication by getting all data at once instead of
  single byte reads
- multi-command communication
- improved error handling

Required Python 3.5 or later and pySerial (https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)
library.
