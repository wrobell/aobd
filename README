Python library for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle ports.

The code is fork of

- https://github.com/brendan-w/python-OBD
- https://github.com/peterh/pyobd
- https://github.com/Pbartek/pyobd-pi

The goals

- use bytes only for command handling
- asyncio based API
- speed up serial port communication by getting all data at once instead of
  single byte reads
- multi-command communication
- improved error handling

Required Python 3.5 or later and pySerial (https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)
library.

Quick install (library has no release yet)::

    $ git clone https://github.com/wrobell/aobd.git
    $ cd aobd

Example of reading vehicle RPM::

    import asyncio
    import aobd

    async def reader(dev):
        await dev.connect()
        response = await dev.query(aobd.commands.RPM)

        print(response.value)
        print(response.unit)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    dev = aobd.OBD('/dev/PORT')
    loop.run_until_complete(reader(dev))

Command-line tools implemented

aobd-list
    List commands supported by vehicle diagnostics port.
aobd-reader
    Read data from vehicle diagnostics port.
aobd-recorder
    Save data from vehicle diagnostics port and GPS into HDF file.
aobd-replay
    Replay data sent to serial device from log file created by
    `aobd-reader` or `aobd-list` command-line tools.
